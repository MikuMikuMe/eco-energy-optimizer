# Eco-Energy-Optimizer

Creating an Eco-Energy-Optimizer that analyzes energy consumption data in real-time involves several components such as data collection, data processing, analysis, and providing actionable suggestions. Below is a simplified example of how you might implement such a platform in Python. Note that a real-world implementation would likely require integration with sensor devices and access to real-time data feeds, possibly through APIs or IoT platforms.

```python
import random
import time
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Sample data structure to represent energy consumption data
class EnergyData:
    def __init__(self, timestamp, building, consumption_kw):
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.building = building
        self.consumption_kw = consumption_kw

# Simulate real-time data fetching from sensors or APIs
def fetch_real_time_data():
    # For the sake of this example, generating random data
    buildings = ['Residential1', 'Residential2', 'Commercial1', 'Commercial2']
    timestamp = time.time()
    building = random.choice(buildings)
    consumption_kw = random.uniform(0.5, 10.0)  # Random consumption between 0.5 kW and 10 kW
    return EnergyData(timestamp, building, consumption_kw)

# Analyze energy consumption and provide suggestions
def analyze_data(energy_data):
    try:
        # In a real-world application, this part would involve data analytics with historical data
        if energy_data.consumption_kw > 8.0:
            suggestion = f"{energy_data.building}: High consumption detected, consider reducing usage of non-essential appliances."
        elif energy_data.consumption_kw < 3.0:
            suggestion = f"{energy_data.building}: Consumption is efficient."
        else:
            suggestion = f"{energy_data.building}: Monitor the usage, making sure smart devices are in energy-saving mode."
        return suggestion
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error("Error while analyzing data: {}".format(e))
        return None

# Main function to run the Eco-Energy-Optimizer
def eco_energy_optimizer():
    try:
        while True:
            # Fetch real-time energy consumption data
            energy_data = fetch_real_time_data()
            logging.info(f"Data fetched: Building={energy_data.building}, Consumption={energy_data.consumption_kw} kW")

            # Analyze and get suggestions
            suggestion = analyze_data(energy_data)
            if suggestion:
                logging.info(f"Suggestion: {suggestion}")

            # Sleep for a defined interval to simulate real-time processing
            time.sleep(5)  # For example, fetching data every 5 seconds
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        logging.info("Eco-Energy-Optimizer stopped by user.")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error("Unexpected error encountered: {}".format(e))

# Run the optimizer
if __name__ == "__main__":
    eco_energy_optimizer()
```

### Explanation:
- **Logging**: Used to track and log events and errors.
- **EnergyData Class**: Represents a data entry that encapsulates the timestamp, building name, and energy consumption (in kilowatts).
- **fetch_real_time_data Function**: Simulates real-time data collection by generating random consumption values for different buildings.
- **analyze_data Function**: Logical analysis of the consumption data to determine whether consumption is high or efficient and provide suggestions accordingly.
- **eco_energy_optimizer Function**: The main loop fetching and processing the data, which can be stopped using a keyboard interrupt. It handles unexpected exceptions to prevent crashes.

### Features for a Full Implementation:
- Connect to real IoT sensors or energy data APIs.
- Integrate with machine learning models for better suggestion accuracy.
- Store and analyze historical data to detect patterns and further optimize suggestions.
- Implement user interfaces for end-users to interact with the platform.
